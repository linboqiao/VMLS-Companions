# VMLS-Python-and-Julia-Companion
*This is a companion to the Python and Julia companion for:
"Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" by Boyd and Vandenberghe. Which you can find here: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/.

You can find notebooks with implementations in both Python and Julia that are direct references to the companion.

This is best perused in conjunction to the first degree companion: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls-julia-companion.pdf.

You can also find a Python companion put together by Leung and Matyspura here: https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/21370

To run Julia in a jupyter kernel, Julia offers documentation here: https://pkg.julialang.org/docs/IJulia/nfu7T/1.9.3/. Also note that if you use `brew` as a primary package manager connected to your kernels, it will automatically setup the kernel for you when you run `brew cask install julia`.
